            The majority of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average adult. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which are designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. These delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing meals, simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal—the choice is yours!<br><br>
            Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple subscriptions.

            The majority of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average adult. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which are designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. These delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing meals, simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal—the choice is yours!<br><br>
            Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple subscriptions.
